# Isilon Skill

Use this note before mounting, testing, or transferring data to/from CU
Anschutz's DBMI Isilon storage from a local machine. See
`.agents/skills/petalibrary.md` for the PetaLibrary side of an
Isilon-to-PetaLibrary transfer, and `.agents/skills/alpine.md` for Alpine/HPC
knowledge — this file covers Isilon specifically.

**Data handling rule for this file, and for working with any real Isilon
mount in this project: never record real share names, file names, directory
names, or directory listings from inside an Isilon share in this skill, in
commit messages, or anywhere else committed to the repo.** Isilon shares here
are lab-specific and can contain Confidential or Highly Confidential data per
CU's data classification policy — the share name itself can identify a lab.
It's fine to create, read, and delete disposable throwaway test files/dirs on
a live share to validate behavior — just don't name or describe real shares
or content anywhere durable.

## Current Position

- Isilon here means CU Anschutz's "Isilon Central File Server," accessed over
  SMB from host `data.ucdenver.pvt`, requested per-lab via
  `dbmi@medschool.zendesk.com` with a SpeedType for billing. See What Isilon
  Is.
- The CU-DBMI `data-storage` repo ships a mount script
  (`src/mount_isilon.sh`) that mounts any share at
  `//data.ucdenver.pvt/dept/SOM/DBMI/<share>` to `~/mnt/<share>` using
  `mount_smbfs` on macOS or `mount.cifs` on Linux. See Mounting A Share.
- One lab share on this machine is real, currently mounted, and matches the
  script's `~/mnt/<share>` convention exactly — used below as the validated
  reference mount. Its name is intentionally not recorded here (see the data
  handling rule above); if you need to reference it directly, check `mount |
  grep smbfs` locally rather than looking for a name in this file.
- A second share name that was expected to also be live turned out **not**
  to be a real share — confirmed by trying the exact mount the script would
  attempt, plus several case variants, all rejected server-side with
  `No such file or directory`. That response is itself useful signal: the
  server was reachable and authenticated fine (same as for the real share),
  so this specifically means the share doesn't exist under that name/path,
  not a VPN or credentials problem. See Distinguishing "Share Doesn't Exist"
  From Network/Auth Failures.
- A cross-share comparison (real share vs. a second share) was requested but
  couldn't be completed — the second name wasn't real, and no other live
  share was available in this session. See Open Questions.
- A small, non-destructive throughput probe against the live reference share
  measured **~26 MB/s sequential write** over SMB/VPN, using a disposable,
  prefixed, immediately-deleted test file. A true cold-read number wasn't
  obtained — see Small Experiment: Throughput On A Live Share for why and
  what would close that gap.

## What Isilon Is

*Source: CU-DBMI `data-storage` repo, `docs/data-transfer-guide.md`.*

Isilon is described there as the primary named storage system for CU
Anschutz DBMI work — a "Central File Server" billed via SpeedType allocation.
To request Isilon storage for DBMI work, contact
`dbmi@medschool.zendesk.com`; current rates are listed under "Isilon Central
File Server" on the CU Anschutz OIT Billing and Rates page. For Confidential
or Highly Confidential data, the share itself must be separately confirmed as
approved for that classification, with access limited to authorized users —
requesting a share doesn't automatically clear it for sensitive data.

## Mounting A Share

*Scope: general — macOS and Linux, from a local machine or any host with
network/VPN reachability to `data.ucdenver.pvt`. VPN is required when
off-campus.*

The CU-DBMI mount script, run directly from GitHub:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CU-DBMI/data-storage/main/src/mount_isilon.sh | sh
```

Safer variant that lets you read the script before running it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CU-DBMI/data-storage/main/src/mount_isilon.sh -o /tmp/mount_isilon.sh
less /tmp/mount_isilon.sh
sh /tmp/mount_isilon.sh
```

The script accepts any of these input styles interactively (placeholders
below stand in for a real lab/share name — the CU-DBMI doc's own examples use
real lab names, which this skill deliberately doesn't repeat):

```text
<LabOrShareName>
dbmi/<LabOrShareName>
smb://data.ucdenver.pvt/dept/som/dbmi/dbmi/<LabOrShareName>
```

What it actually does (read directly from the script, confirmed by matching
its behavior manually — see below):

- A bare name (no `/` prefix, no `smb://`) is expanded to
  `//data.ucdenver.pvt/dept/SOM/DBMI/<name>`.
- A `smb://...` or `//...` input is used as the literal UNC path instead.
- The local mount point is always `~/mnt/<last-path-component>`, matching
  this machine's existing `~/mnt/<share>` convention for other mounts.
- Prompts for a local file/dir permission mode, default `775`.
- Pings the extracted host first and fails fast with a VPN/network hint if
  unreachable, before attempting the mount.
- macOS: `mount_smbfs -d <mode> -f <mode> "<share>" "<mount_point>"`, using
  the current login keychain for credentials if available (no interactive
  prompt in that case).
- Linux: installs `cifs-utils` if missing (`apt-get` or `yum`), prompts for a
  CIFS/Anschutz username, then
  `mount -t cifs "<share>" "<mount_point>" -o username=...,uid=...,gid=...,domainauto,file_mode=...,dir_mode=...`.

**Manually reproducing the same mount** (equivalent to what the script does,
useful when scripting or testing without the interactive prompts), macOS:

```bash
mount_smbfs -d 0775 -f 0775 "//data.ucdenver.pvt/dept/SOM/DBMI/<share>" "$HOME/mnt/<share>"
```

Confirmed in this project: this exact invocation authenticated automatically
via the existing login keychain entry for `data.ucdenver.pvt` — no
interactive credential prompt — for both a share that exists (already
mounted, so it correctly reported already-in-use) and a share name that
doesn't exist (cleanly rejected server-side). This means the manual form is
safe to script/test with non-interactively on a machine that already has a
working keychain entry for the host; a machine without one would presumably
need the interactive credential prompt the script relies on `mount_smbfs`'s
own default behavior for — not yet tested here.

Windows and a from-scratch macOS Finder walkthrough are documented separately
in the CU SOM knowledge base:
`https://medschool.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/360005463054-Map-to-SOM-Network-Drive`
(not fetched into this skill — check there directly if the command-line path
doesn't fit).

## Distinguishing "Share Doesn't Exist" From Network/Auth Failures

*Scope: general troubleshooting, macOS `mount_smbfs`.*

Confirmed directly in this project: `mount_smbfs` gives a clearly different
error depending on failure cause, which is a fast first diagnostic:

- **`No such file or directory`** — the server was reached and the client
  authenticated, but the specific share/path doesn't exist. This is what
  every attempt at the non-real share name returned in this project. Don't
  chase VPN or credentials on this error; re-check the share name and case
  with whoever administers it instead.
- **`File exists`** — a local mount-point conflict, not a remote problem. See
  the CU-DBMI doc's own FAQ for this (stale mount entry, already mounted,
  or a directory in a state macOS won't mount over):
  ```bash
  mount | grep <ShareName>          # already mounted?
  umount ~/mnt/<ShareName>          # unmount if so
  diskutil unmount ~/mnt/<ShareName>  # if umount reports "Resource busy"
  ls -la ~/mnt/<ShareName>          # if not mounted, is it just an empty dir?
  rmdir ~/mnt/<ShareName>           # remove if empty and unmounted, then retry
  ```
- **New in this project, a variant of the `File exists` case**: attempting to
  `umount` a share that's *currently mounted and working* (not stale) can
  itself return `Resource busy` if something still holds it open, and an
  immediate `mount_smbfs` retry on the same mount point then correctly fails
  `File exists` because the old mount never actually released. This is a
  different root cause than the doc's own FAQ (an active, healthy mount vs.
  a leftover/failed one) but produces the same-shaped error. Use
  `diskutil unmount` first in this case too, and re-check `mount | grep
  <ShareName>` before retrying rather than assuming the first `umount`
  succeeded.
- No network/ping failure was reproduced in this project (VPN/network was
  reachable throughout), so that failure path is documented from the
  CU-DBMI guide only, not independently confirmed here.

## Small Experiment: Throughput On A Live Share

*Scope: one real, live share (name deliberately not recorded — see the data
handling rule at the top of this file), disposable test data only, no real
share content named or referenced.*

Method: created a dotfile-prefixed, PID-suffixed test file at the share root
(`~/mnt/<share>/.claude-isilon-throughput-test-<pid>`), timed a sequential
write, timed a read, then deleted it immediately and confirmed removal.

Results:

- Sequential write, 20 MB: `~26 MB/s` (`20971520 bytes in 0.805s`)
- Sequential write, 50 MB: `~26 MB/s` (`52428800 bytes in 1.98s`) — consistent
  with the smaller run, so `~26 MB/s` looks like a real network-write number,
  not noise.
- Read, both attempts: multiple GB/s, clearly serviced from the local page
  cache (macOS SMB client caches a just-written file), **not** a real network
  read number. Attempting to force a cold read via `umount`/remount hit the
  `Resource busy` → `File exists` gotcha above, so a true cold-read number
  wasn't captured in this session.
- The live mount was left healthy and unaffected — confirmed via `mount |
  grep smbfs` and a successful `stat` after the aborted remount attempt.

Interpretation: `~26 MB/s` sequential write over SMB/VPN to Isilon is a
reasonable planning number for small interactive tests, but this is `n=1`,
one file size regime, one moment in time, and says nothing about read
throughput, many-small-file performance, or behavior under concurrent access.
Treat it as a rough calibration point, not a benchmark.

## Isilon → PetaLibrary Transfer (Globus)

*Scope: when moving data from an Isilon share to a PetaLibrary allocation.
Documented from the CU-DBMI guide; see `.agents/skills/petalibrary.md`
Globus Access for the PetaLibrary-side setup steps referenced here.*

The CU-DBMI guide's recommended workflow:

1. Connect to VPN if off-campus.
2. Mount the Isilon share on a workstation (Mounting A Share above).
3. Install and configure Globus Connect Personal on that workstation.
4. Expose the mounted Isilon folder through the local Globus endpoint.
5. In the Globus web interface, connect the local endpoint to the
   PetaLibrary endpoint (see `.agents/skills/petalibrary.md` for the actual
   PetaLibrary-side collection name and login flow).
6. Start with a small test transfer; validate it before running the full
   transfer.
7. Validate files at the destination (file counts/sizes, checksum a sample)
   before removing or archiving the source copy.

The guide explicitly warns: Isilon snapshots and disaster-recovery
replication are not a substitute for transfer validation — confirm the
destination copy directly even when both are in place. It also warns against
routing this kind of transfer through OneDrive or another constrained
intermediate location.

## Before You Transfer (checklist from the CU-DBMI guide)

*Scope: general — applies to any Isilon-involving transfer, not just
Isilon→PetaLibrary.*

Confirm before starting:

- Source and destination locations, and the data owner (PI is the default
  accountable owner unless a different technical owner is required).
- The SpeedType/funding source for billable Isilon or PetaLibrary storage.
- Data classification: Public, Confidential, or Highly Confidential, per
  CU's Data Classification guidance.
- Whether the data include HIPAA, PHI, identifiable participant data, or
  other data with additional restrictions.
- Who/which service accounts need access at the destination.
- VPN access for internal CU Anschutz resources.
- Expected data size and file count; whether the transfer needs to be
  resumable and verified (favor Globus over manual copy for large/many-file
  transfers).
- Whether the old copy must be retained temporarily for rollback.

For large transfers, move a small test folder first and validate it before
starting the full transfer. **Do not transfer Highly Confidential data**
until the data owner and campus IT/security have confirmed the source,
destination, workstation, transfer tool, and access controls are approved
for that classification — this applies to Isilon, PetaLibrary, Globus,
Globus Connect Personal, and any intermediate system. CU Boulder OIT
guidance says to contact the Office of Information Security before choosing
a tool for Highly-Confidential-classified research data specifically.

## Important Failure Modes

- Do not treat `mount_smbfs: ... No such file or directory` as a VPN/network
  problem — it means the server was reached and auth succeeded, but that
  specific share/path doesn't exist. Re-check the name/case instead of
  troubleshooting connectivity.
- Do not assume a failed `umount` means the mount is gone — check `mount |
  grep <name>` again before retrying `mount_smbfs`, and use `diskutil
  unmount` if plain `umount` reports `Resource busy`.
- Do not benchmark "read throughput" by reading a file immediately after
  writing it on the same mount without clearing the client cache first — the
  local page cache will report multi-GB/s numbers that have nothing to do
  with the actual network/share performance.
- Do not write real Isilon share names, file/directory names, listings, or
  content into this skill, commit messages, or any other durable repo
  artifact — share names here are lab-identifying, and some shares may hold
  Confidential or Highly Confidential data. Disposable, clearly-marked test
  files are fine to create and immediately delete for validation.
- Do not initiate a Highly Confidential data transfer through Isilon,
  PetaLibrary, or Globus without the data owner's and campus IT/security's
  explicit sign-off on every hop (source, destination, workstation, tool).

## Open Questions

- What is a second real, accessible DBMI Isilon share to properly compare
  against the one validated in this session (the original ask that motivated
  this skill)? The second name tried is confirmed not to be one. Once
  identified, repeat the throughput probe above against it and compare
  like-for-like — keep the actual share names out of what gets committed.
- What does a genuinely cold SMB read throughput number look like for a
  share like this? Needs a clean way to drop the local page cache (a real
  unmount cycle without hitting the `Resource busy` conflict, or reading
  from a second client/host) that wasn't achieved in this session.
- Does this machine's keychain-based no-prompt `mount_smbfs` behavior hold
  for other DBMI Isilon shares/users, or is it specific to already having a
  cached credential for `data.ucdenver.pvt` from mounting the reference share
  previously? Untested against a host with no prior keychain entry.
- Is there a CURC/DBMI-documented expected throughput or latency range for
  Isilon over VPN to compare the `~26 MB/s` write figure against, or is
  informal measurement like this the only calibration available?
